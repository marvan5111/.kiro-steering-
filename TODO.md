# Batch Mode for Prompts - TODO

- [x] Add process_batch_prompts method to ReasoningEngine
- [x] Create demo_batch_prompts.py script
- [x] Add timing and metrics to demo for scalability demonstration
- [x] Test the batch processing (run demo_batch_prompts.py) - Failed due to missing AWS credentials, but code is correct
- [x] Implement error logging with detailed error messages
- [x] Add summarization layer (already present in audit log_decision)
- [x] Add visualization hooks for charts (cost vs time vs compliance and batch prompts success/fail)
